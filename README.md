# FilmPicker ðŸŽ¬

**FilmPicker** is a simple CLI application built to help you discover movies based on genres. You can search for films, view their details, and even save your favorite films for later. This tool is especially helpful when you're struggling to decide what to watch!

## Features
- **Genre-based movie search**: Select a genre and get a list of films.
- **View movie details**: See the title, release date, overview, and language of the movie.
- **Save your favorites**: Add your favorite movies to a "saved list" and view them later.
- **Easy-to-use CLI**: Simple interface to interact with the app in your terminal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this app locally, you need:
- Ruby (version 2.0 or higher)
- `dotenv` gem for loading environment variables (API keys)
- An active API key for [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). You will need to create a `.env` file with your API key.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/filmpicker.git
   cd filmpicker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
If youâ€™re starting with this repo for the first time, make sure to install the required gems.

3. Set up the environment file:

	â€¢	Add your TMDb API key like this:

  TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

4. Run the app:
In your terminal, run:

```bash
ruby filmpicker.rb

The app will prompt you to choose what youâ€™d like to do: find a movie, see your saved movies, or exit.

	1.	Find a film to watch: Choose a genre, view a list of movies, and see movie details.
